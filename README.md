🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using a machine learning model trained on a medical dataset. It leverages supervised learning techniques to provide accurate and interpretable predictions based on various patient health metrics.

🔍 Features
Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for training

User-friendly interface to input patient data

Model trained on key features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

Visualizations for better understanding of data and results

Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML model training and evaluation

Joblib – model serialization

Streamlit / Tkinter (if GUI used) – for deploying interface (optional)
